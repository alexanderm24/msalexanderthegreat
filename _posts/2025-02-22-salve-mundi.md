*Salve munde!* Hello, World!

This site might not look like much, but I have been hard at work learning about front-end web development, specifically static website generators. This one is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. For my personal sanity, I have decided that I will hold off on all aesthetics and use this default for now. The teaching profession already consumes much of my time, and I have been itching to document my experiences and resources. Fonts and colors will have to be on standby, for now.

The content of these posts will range from formal articles on Latin pedagogy to cataloguing personal learning milestones ... most recently, I feel inspired to read 20 lines of the Odyssey in its original Greek daily before [Nolan's film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33764258/) is released in July of 2026. More on that in a separate post to come.

I might just be writing into the void, but I feel blessed and excited to document a piece of my life.

-Ms. Alexander
